## Description

<a name="description" />

"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions â€“ only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.

Owning to the fact that it is already a well-known game, for a lot of people it whould be a dream to take part in this competition. Using my game, they have the opportunity to simulate this TV Show and, at the same time, to have fun with their friends. The difference between my game and the TV Game is that, using my game, the users have the multiplayer option, which make it more competitive and they do not need to wait until the previous player finish. Moreover, they have the chance to play for a consistent prize.
