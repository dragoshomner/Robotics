## Description

<a name="description" />

"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" is an international television game show franchise of British origin, created by David Briggs, Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight. In its format, currently owned and licensed by Sony Pictures Television, contestants tackle a series of multiple-choice questions to win large cash prizes in a format that twists on many game show genre conventions â€“ only one contestant plays at a time, similar to radio quizzes; contestants are given the question before attempting an answer, and have no time limit to answer questions; and the amount offered increases as they tackle questions that become increasingly difficult. The maximum cash prize offered in most versions of the format is one million of the local currency.

Owning to the fact that it is already a well-known game, for a lot of people it whould be a dream to take part in this competition. Using my game, they have the opportunity to simulate this TV Show and, at the same time, to have fun with their friends. The difference between my game and the TV Game is that, using my game, the users have the multiplayer option, which make it more competitive and they do not need to wait until the previous player finish. Moreover, they have the chance to play for a consistent prize.

<h4>General descriptions</h4>
<a name="general-descriptions" />
The goal of the game is to test your ability to understand, to interpret thw question and to manage time so as to give the correct answer in the right time. All of this added up to the fact that you have only three lives (wrong answers), which you have to manage as smart as you can.

The users roles are the followings: one admin, who asks questions and start the round, and two players, who have to give the correct answer to the questions. After every round, every player will see if he gave a good response, or a bad one, by looking at the color of the led (green = correct and red = wrong). 

<h4>Setup</h4>

A big advantage of this game is that it is very easy to use. The only thing that you have to do is to plug in the battery. And that's all! The 4-digits display will light up, the admin have to press the button, and the game will start. 

Related to the players position, the admin have to sit in front of the lateral box and to place his hand so as his answer not to be visible to the other two players. 

<h4>Start game</h4>
<a name="start-game" />
After the game was powered on, the game start. The players have the posibility to put the bet in the box in the front of the admin panel. The way how the prizes will be split is debated between them before the game starts. The admin need to press the round button and a new duel will start. He will ask the question to the users and will press a button, corresponding to the correct answer. After that, will press the round button. Now, the players can give the answer. 

They will not see the opponent's answer until both of them respond. Now, automatically, the display will show every player's answer, which will be visible by all, but if their answer is good or not can be seen only by him. The game go on, until a player lose all of his lives. 

If a player lose and the other one still has lives, the winner's display will print "UP" and the loser's display will print "LOSE". If they lose their lives at the same time, both displays will print "UP". For a new game, the admin will press round button, and a new game will start.
