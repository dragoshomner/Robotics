# MemMove 
**The game that makes you smarter and more fit.**

With 86 billion neurons, 400 miles of capillaries, 100 thousand miles of axons (enough to circle the earth 4 times), more than 10 trillion synapses, the human brain is estimated to store equivalent to up to 2.5 million gigabytes of storage. That's amazing! Despite this fact,  most adults have an attention span of 20 minutes and short-term memory can hold up to 7 pieces of information at the same time... but only for around 20 seconds. That's sad! The good news are that this statistics can be improved :)

If all 600 muscles in your body pulled in one direction, you could lift 25 tons. Again, that's amazing! Despite this fact, more than 80% of adults do not meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, and more than 80% of adolescents do not do enough aerobic physical activity to meet the guidelines for youth. Again, that's sad! The good news are that this statistics can be improved :)

MemMove helps you to improve your attention, memory, physical condition and reaction speed. The rules are simple: you will see on the matrix a sequence of instructions which you will have to execute. Sounds easy? Let's start!
